        <p>There have been efforts to record the histories of the <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.3138/j.ctt2ttq6z">Royal Ontario Museum (ROM)</a> and the <a href="http://publications.gc.ca/site/eng/9.649945/publication.html">Canadian Museum of History</a>, but where are the voices of children within these histories? As <a href="overview.html" target="_blank">discussed</a>, children have made up a significant portion of the visitors to museums, and many museum programs have been directed towards children. Despite this, the voices of children are often difficult to find, as adults are the ones writing the histories of museums. When children are acknowledged, their voices are often curated to suit the needs of the curator, who is often affiliated with the museum itself. Reviews and critiques of museum exhibits written by adults are easy to find, but where can we look to find out what children have thought about their experiences in museums?</p>
        <p>Below is a collection of sources that acknowledge children in museums throughout history. Each source has a different reason for listening to children, and thus has its own set of limitations in regard to its use as a reliable source.</p>

          <h3><a id="Museums_Surveying_Children_Throughout_History_5"></a>Museums Surveying Children Throughout History</h3>
          <p>Museums have made efforts to pay attention to the experiences of children visitors throughout history. Surveys began in the 1960s and continued into the Internet age. Surveys provide insight into the experiences of museum visitors, but there are sometimes gaps in reliability, as discussed in the examples below.</p>
          <h4><a id="1960_Visitor_Survey_by_the_Royal_Ontario_Museum_8"></a>1960 Visitor Survey by the Royal Ontario Museum</h4>
          <p><a href="https://archive.org/details/museumvisitor02roya"><img src="images/rom-survey.jpg" alt="ROM Visitory Survey"></a></p>
          <p>In the early 1960s, the <a href="https://archive.org/details/museumvisitor02roya">ROM began conducting visitor surveys</a>. These surveys asked questions relating to age, gender, reason for visiting, and more. While the surveys provide insight into factors such as <a href="https://archive.org/stream/museumvisitor02roya#page/18/mode/2up">why students decided to visit the museum</a>, gaps exist. One significant gap exists where the survey results state:</p>
          <blockquote>
          <p>Children under seven or eight years of age were difficult to interview, and often their interviews could not be completed and hence were not included in the sample. <a href="https://archive.org/stream/museumvisitor02roya#page/28/mode/2up">View survey</a></p>

        <h4><a id="1999_Online_Visitor_Survey_by_the_Canadian_Childrens_Museum_15"></a>1999 Online Visitor Survey by the Canadian Children’s Museum</h4>
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19990220100158/http://www.civilization.ca:80/cmc/cmceng/webform.html"><img src="images/children-survey.jpg" alt="CMCC Survey"></a></p>
        <p>In 1999, the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation had a dedicated site for the Canadian Children’s Museum.This section of the website included a survey for website visitors. The survey is directed at young children, as evidenced by the default age being “6 and under” and the second question asking whether the visitor is with their parent, friends, brother or sister, etc. The internet survey presents a different perspective from the ROM’s 1960s survey in that it is specially crafted for younger respondants. At the same time, the survey asks for the respondent’s personal information (eg. name, address), presenting potential ethical issues. The reality of the Internet means that there is no guarantee of the parental supervision that there is in an in-person museum visit; ethical issues arise in whether it is acceptable for a museum corporation to be asking children for their personal information. On top of ethical issues, reliability can come into question; there is no guarantee that information entered in an online form will be truthful.</p>

        <h4><a id="2002_Canadian_Childrens_Museum_Survey_for_Armoured_Warrior_Game_21"></a>2002 Canadian Children’s Museum Survey for <em>Armoured Warrior</em> Game</h4>
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021212234029/http://www.civilization.ca:80/cwm/armwar/survey.html"><img src="images/war-survey.jpg" alt="War Survey"></a></p>
        <p>This survey, created to give feedback surrounding an online game that is discussed in the <a href="exhibit.html">following exhibit</a>, asks specific questions regarding the experience of the game. The survey sets the respondant’s age at a minimum of 10–19 years, making the assumption that anyone younger would not be playing the game. Such an assumption exlcudes the possibility of knowlingly hearing from children under the age of 10.</p>

        <h3><a id="ROM_ReCollects_Saturday_Morning_Club_36"></a>ROM ReCollects: “Saturday Morning Club”</h3>
        <p>To celebrate the 100th anniversary of the ROM in 2014, the museum ran <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/romrecollects/home">ROM ReCollects: A History of the ROM as told by its Visitors</a>. Visitors submitted stories about their past experiences at the ROM, supplemented by a timeline of events by the ROM ReCollects editor, Julia Matthews.</p>
        <p>One section of the ROM ReCollects stories covers the Saturday Morning Club, a program for children that began in the ROM’s early days and exists today. <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/romrecollects/stories/keyword/saturday-morning-club">Five stories exist</a> that reference the Saturday Morning Club. What must be noted, however, is that many of these stories are written about the experiences of either current or former employees of the ROM. While the positivity contained in these experiences should not be dismissed, the bias of the sample must be noted. For example, it is highly unlikely that someone who did not enjoy visiting the museum as a child would detail their experiences for the purposes of ROM ReCollects.</p>
        <h4><a id="Selected_Excerpts_41"></a>Selected Excerpts:</h4>
        <blockquote>
        <p>My first experience with the ROM was in the mid 60’s when my brother and I participated in the Saturday Morning Club.  What is interesting is I have no recollection of adults being part of our experience.  I remember having free rein of the museum galleries and it being simply great.<br>

        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Changing schools and moving so far from friends was not easy for me in my early adolescence. My parents realized this and hoped that not only would I learn about the world’s cultures but that I might make new friends by attending the ROM’s Saturday Morning Club. I was terribly shy so I don’t recollect making friends with my co-SMC’s but my horizons were certainly broadened by the museum’s collections that were showcased each Saturday.<br>

        <h3><a id="ROM_photographs_by_Michel_Lambeth_19231977_49"></a>ROM photographs by Michel Lambeth (1923–1977)</h3>
        <p><a href="http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/michel-lambeth/">Michel Lambeth</a> was a Canadian photographer who captured many Toronto scenes. The below photos were taken by Lambeth in 1957 in the Royal Ontario Museum. Unlike many of the experiences described within annual reports or museum-associated histories, Lambeth’s photographs show a diversity of reactions towards museum exhibits. While the first photo shows children engaging with the exhibits in a more formal manner, the following photos provide a look into the more informal interactions that took place within the museum.</p>
        <p>What is missing from the photos is identification of who the subjects are. Their identities are unclear; it is not said whether Lambeth knew the children and whether he asked them to pose. Given his career as a photojournalist, and through <a href="http://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/portrait-portal/Pages/PProfile.aspx?PersonKey=290315">looking at his other work</a>, it is likely that the photographs are candids.</p>
        <p>Each of the following photos link to its respective source, either to the National Gallery of Canada or the Library and Archives Canada.</p>
