        <p>As museums have expanded further into the public sphere, putting more and more resources towards children’s programming as well as towards advertising to entice children to visit, the types of learning offered by museums has changed. Though learning formats may have changed, certain exhibit subjects have remained remarkably consistent. Two topics discussed in this section, war and Ancient Egypt, have been deemed suitable learning subjects for children throughout history. Though children may now engage with exhibitions online or through interactive play rather than through visiting exhibitions intended for adults, these topics have appeared to stick in the minds of children throughout history.</p>

        <h3><a id="Teaching_Children_About_War_3"></a>Teaching Children About War</h3>
        <p>In the late nineteenth century, it was commonplace for children in Canada to own toy guns and air guns. Advertisements encouraged young boys to learn how to use guns.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> Today, air guns are not marketed towards young boys; however, childhood play associating violence with fun is still accepted. Take <a href="http://globalnews.ca/news/3632930/kids-attack-edmonton-police-officer-with-nerf-guns-hilarity-ensues/">Nerf guns</a>, for example, or the <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Army_Men">soldier figurines in Toy Story</a>. Wide acceptance of war- and violence- related games for children can be seen in the Canadian War Museum’s creation of an internet war game for children in the early 2000s, called <em>Armoured Warrior</em> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021001082849/http://www.civilization.ca:80/kids/kidse.asp">available for viewing through the Wayback Machine</a>.</p>
        <p>Museum websites from the early days of the Internet are consistently less formal; before standards were developed around how websites should look and function to the extent that they are today, web content and graphics designed for institutions generally did not meet the same brand standards that had been commonplace in print materials. In the case of the Canadian War Museum’s <em>Armoured Warrior</em>, the welcome page does not abide by the Museum’s branding. There is little to suggest that the game was created as a resource for a National Museum:</p>
        <p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021001110939/http://www.civilization.ca:80/cwm/armwar/indexwareng.html"><img src="images/war1.png" alt="War Museum Intro Page"></a></p>
        <p>The informal design of the game creates more excitement around the idea of a war game; the game makes use of more exciting fonts and dramatic colours, suggesting that the game could have been made by anyone, rather than by a museum. At the same time, problems arise around the credibility of the game. Its informal design means that other, non-professional games that take on a similar look and feel, are equal in terms of credibility. This war game is at once implying that other internet games are just as valid resources for information, while diminishing its own credibility as an educational resource.</p>
        <p>Another potential problem surrounding the Museum’s war game is the inability to enforce supervision. According to the after-play survey, the game was intended for children <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021212234029/http://www.civilization.ca:80/cwm/armwar/survey.html">ten and up</a>, but placing a game on the Web means that anyone of any age can gain access.</p>
        <p>Today, the Canadian War Museum has an updated <a href="http://www.warmuseum.ca/overthetop/">interactive war adventure game</a>. This game is more visually refined, but it faces the same reality of having no restraints on access according to age. The creation of internet-based war “adventures” by museums shows that war games from the early twentieth century are still present in alternate forms today. Their potential as a learning resource shows the continued acceptance around making war into a game for children. The specific Internet adventure Armoured Warrior, from the early 2000s, provides insight into the extent to which it has been acceptable to dramatize war for children outside of a formal learning environment.</p>

        <h3><a id="Egypt_for_Children_20"></a>Egypt for Children</h3>
        <p>Another common theme that has consistently popped up and been directed toward children in museums is Ancient Egypt.</p>
        <p>In 2000, the ROM held the exhibit Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids, which became the most successful exhibit in the Museum’s history.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1:1">[1]</a></sup> Much of the exhibit’s success depended upon children and school groups visiting the museum. The exhibit included a “Pyramid Maker’s children’s area, sponsored by the Investor’s Group Inc.,” which included facepainting and storytelling, while other areas of the museum put on activities such as dress-up games.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Children visiting the ROM had been drawn to exhibitions relating to Ancient Egypt long before the Museum’s 2000 exhibition. Several stories gathered through ROM ReCollects mention the experience of being drawn to Egypt as children:</p>
        <p>Milton Holmes writes of being a grade 5 student in the 1970s:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I went to my favourite ROM exhibit: the mummies. Since it was early in the day in the middle of the week, I found myself alone with the mummy. After examining him and reading about him, I had the opportunity to stand quietly alone with him. Even at my young age, I imagined I could feel what it would have been like to have been one of the mummy’s servants buried alive with the corpse. This remains one of the most powerful and interesting revelations of my childhood.<br>

        <p>Rachel Berman writes of being 10 years old in the 1970s:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>When I was ten, I was a member of the ROM’s Saturday Morning Club. I had recently had my ears pierced for my tenth birthday, which was a pretty big deal at the time. Our group was looking at a display of Egyptian jewelry when the leader asked if anyone had pierced ears. My hand shot up. She took a gorgeous, ornate, and very large gold hoop shaped earring out of the case, and I got to try it on. I still remember the feeling of weight on my ear all these years later. I doubt for many reasons anything like that happens at the ROM today!<br>

        <p>Jennifer Joiner writes of being 10 years old in the 1960s:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The ROM was familiar to us so we were nothing but happy and content as we moved through our favorite exhibits, especially the mummy in the back part of the Egyptian section. We lingered a long time over the many small artifacts then displayed under the rows of waist-high glass-covered vitrines, drawing many little mirrors, tools and figurines carefully in our drawing pads and I remember faithfully writing down all the label information for each.<br>

        <p>Gayle Gibson, ROM educator, writes of being in grade school in the 1950s:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>I kept being drawn to Egypt.  I’d copy hieroglyphs and try to find names or I’d study a single case and draw the artifacts in it.  The mummies scared me until one day I saw a five by three card on a glass case. I went over and read that the body inside was a man named Antjau. I said a prayer for him, and we’ve been good friends ever since. Knowing his name somehow made it all right to look at him, and to study his coffin. Soon, I got to know the other mummies, too.  Eventually, I learned their language and visited their country.  I’ve been studying Ancient Egypt now for well over fifty years.<br>

        <p>The interest children showed towards Ancient Egypt in museums continued into the Internet era. In addition to the Armoured Warrior game, the CMCC’s kid’s website from 2002 included a section to “Explore King Tut’s Tomb.” The website provides images of artifacts and tomb reconstructions, encouraging visitors to explore. It is unclear as to how many visits “Explore King Tut’s Tomb” received. It is likely that the website was trying to allow for similar experiences of wonder as described in ROM ReCollects; web survey results could help compare the experiences of children from ROM ReCollects with those who engaging with the Museum of Civilization online. Museum visitor survey results could help gain insight into whether online experiences were successful in encouraging children to visit the museum in person.</p>
