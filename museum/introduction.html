        <p>This project attempts to answer questions like these by exploring how children and youth have experienced Canadian museums throughout history, as well as how Canadian museums have viewed children over time. The Royal Museum of Ontario and the Canadian Museum of Civilization Corporation, including the Canadian War Museum, provide starting points for understanding how museums have changed to suit the needs of children, for finding the voices of children as museum visitors, and for exploring how museums have taught history to children and youth.</p>
