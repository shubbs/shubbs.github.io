      <div class="section-content overview">
        <p>Today, museums in Canada rely heavily on the attendance of children. In the <a href="http://www.historymuseum.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/arpt1213e.pdf">2012–2013 year</a>, the Canadian Children’s Museum received 390,000 visitors, more than the number of visitors to any other permanent exhibition. Both the Canadian Museum of History and Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) provide programming for children and schools. It has not always been the case, however, that children have been so central to museums. Museums in Canada have held different objectives throughout history, balancing tensions between research, exhibitions, fieldwork, and educational programming.</p>
        <p>Leighann C. Neilson explains that Canada’s national museums have a unique history, where emphasis has traditionally been placed on government sponsorship and heritage, with a focus on marketing the idea of “the sovereign nation.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> This differs from the emergence of museums in Europe, where private museums rose out of the pockets of the wealthy, or in the United States, where private donors “garnered prestige” by transforming private collections into public institutions in the 20th century.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup> The Canadian Museum of History began as the National Museum, which emerged out of the Geological Survey of Canada.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup> The ROM began in the early twentieth funding with funding from the Government of Ontario and the University of Toronto.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn4" id="fnref4">[4]</a></sup> Both of these museums began with affiliations to the public, providing a unique opportunity to consider children as part of the general public. That said, both museums have had to make efforts throughout history to affirm themselves as museums for the public rather than for national research purposes.</p>
        <p>Throughout history, museums have faced tensions between research and public use. The National Museum began as a facility for research, exhibitions, and public lectures, with the goal of representing “the nation to the Canadian people.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">[5]</a></sup>. In the early 20th century, the National Museum a began a lecture series for the public, including people of all ages. Neilson discusses the popularity of these lectures, noting, “Saturday morning lectures were regularly attended by more than one thousand schoolchildren, forcing museum staff to split the group in two and offer lectures at ten and eleven o’clock.” <sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">[6]</a></sup> During the war years and Great Depression, while museums faced budget restrictions, educational programs were not affected while other museum divisions faced cuts, reflecting the value and success of these programs.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">[7]</a></sup></p>
        <p>The ROM  began an education program in 1919, led by Margaret MacLean.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">[8]</a></sup> The program initially consisted of lectures for adults, but MacLean grew the program to include lectures, or “story-hours” for children before the adults’ Saturday afternoon lectures.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">[9]</a></sup> This program eventually evolved into the Saturday Morning Club, <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/whats-on/saturday-club">which still exists today</a>. In terms of the ROM’s interactions with the public, children at the ROM soon became “the solution to the problem of attendance” at the museum.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn10" id="fnref10">[10]</a></sup></p>
        <p>Over time, children have become key visitors to museums, whether through school groups or on family outings. In the 1960s, museums familes as their target customers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn11" id="fnref11">[11]</a></sup> When moving to its current location in 1982, the Canadian Museum of Civilization incorporated the Canadian Children’s Museum, a museum dedicated entirely to children that has continued to expand over the years.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn12" id="fnref12">[12]</a></sup> In 1994, the museum launched “a dynamic and effective advertising campaign” for the reopening of the Children’s museum, showing the Museum’s recognition of children as valuable customers.<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn13" id="fnref13">[13]</a></sup> In 2001, the ROM noted in its annual report, “Engaging families and schoolchildren through our interactive galleries is already paying dividends in membership and revenue.”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn14" id="fnref14">[14]</a></sup> Over time, children have become one of the main, if not <em>the</em> main, target audience of museums.</p>
